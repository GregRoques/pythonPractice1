# # - Programming languages see different types of variable differently.
# print 3+3;
# # Strings
# # Numbers
# # Booleans - true or false, off or on, 1 or 0...binary choices
# # lists - [a, b, c, d, ..., etc.]... same as an array
# # Dictionaries - variable of variables
# # Objects - Super dictionaries

# # Primative Data Types: String, Number, Boolean

# month = "November";

# print type(date)
# date2 = 13.008
# print type(date2)

# % = Modulas. This divides the number and gives you the remainder.

# print 2**3; # 2 to the power of ^3;

# print "-" * 20 # will print 20 dashes; re: in this case, give me 20 of something;
